# Chrome Extension
The coveo-implementation-checker extension allows you validate your Coveo implementation.

## Organization
Check your Coveo Organization. Is it properly configured, Sources, Fields, Extensions, Query Pipelines.
The following checks are made:

For every source 2 queries are being executed. One to check for the field contents, one to check for freshness of the data. More queries are being executed to examine the field contents.
- Type of Infrastructure the Index runs on
- SSD drives
- Nr of Indexers (for fail safe)

Sources
- Types of connectors used
- Contains Push sources
- Contains Crawling modules
- Sources without refresh schedules
- Sources without new content in the last 60 days
- Checker executes a query to check for results, based upon modification date
- Push sources without batch calls
- The Log browser is checked, if there are Batch calls present in the last week
- Normal sources/Push sources without HTML content
- A query is being executed, 500 results are examined if it contains a quickview version
- Content is the same (ends with the same content)
- Only on fields which have ‘Free text’ enabled
- A query is being executed, 500 results are examined
- Log browser errors/warnings
- The Log browser is checked, if there are errors/warnings present in the last week
- Security Identity errors
- Security Provider Schedules. Are they configured, if so are they enabled
- Nr of Security Identities

Fields
- Allmetadatavalues used
- A query is being executed, 500 results are examined. The content is checked for entries of the output of the allmetadatavalues script
- Facet values to long
- A query is being executed, 500 results are examined. If the individual values are exceeding 150 characters a warning is set. If the individual value also contains a delimiter (;), it will be reported in the details section.
Contains HTML
- A query is being executed, 500 results are examined. The values are being checked if they contain HTML tags.
(Large) duplicate content
- A query is being executed, 500 results are examined. The fields are checked for duplicate content. 
- Nr of all fields

Extensions
- Disabled/Error/Slow/Timeout extensions

Query Pipelines
- Nr of Query pipelines
- For each query pipeline:
- ML, Query Suggest enabled
- ML, ART enabled
- ML, Recommendations enabled
- Nr of Thesaurus entries
- Ranking expressions. For each expression a Query Check is made
- Filter expressions. For each expression a Query Check is made
- Warning if a filter is applied, need to set the query pipeline in the search token
- Nr of Featured results

Analytics
- Top Queries
- Low Usage Page/Tab combinations
- Low Click Through % Page/Tab combinations
- Low Click Rank Page/Tab combinations
- Custom Analytics Dimensions
- Click Rank, last week
- Click Through, last week
- No of Searches, last week

Query Checks
- Each q, aq, dq will be checked
- Words which will influence caching will be reported
- Words which should not be used in the basic (q) query will be reported
- Number of nested queries
- Number of requested results
- filterFields, a new query is being executed to examine if they do not contain multiple words (like “this is a test”)
- filterFields, filterFieldRange
- duplicateFiltering
- partialMatch
- wildcardsEnabled
- To many words in query

Facets
- injectionDepth
- maximumNumberOfValues
- generateAutomaticRanges
- Sorting
- If a field is requested as sorted, field should have useCacheForSort enabled

Nested queries
- If a field is used as a nested key, it should have useCacheForNestedQuery enabled
- If a field is used as a nested key, it should be Int 32 format

Numeric queries
- If a field is used with a query like < or >, it should have useCacheForNumericQuery enabled

Query format
- If a query contains multiple OR’s on the same field, it should be rewritten
- If a == is used, warning on usage
- If a = is used, warning on usage

Queries with ==
- Field will be checked with a query, if it only contains single values a recommendation is done to use =

Bad query syntax
- If query contains +or or @date>=1y r or if it contains fields without @ (category=”Cat A”)


## Implementation
The Implementation checker will load all JS files/HTML files the page is loading. All of them are being checked. Based on that it will create the report.

General
- Proper JS UI version
- Hard coded Access tokens
- Search alerts errors
- Searches without analytics

Behavior
- Searches executed, based upon HTTP requests. Searches are recorded for later analysis (See Query Checker). For both Search Box as full Search interface.
- The original search is being re-executed with debug=1, to get the executionReport. The expressions (including Ranking Expressions) will be checked.
- The current token is used to perform additional queries to check for proper field usage.
- Analytics events, based upon HTTP requests
- Visitor changed during events
- Get token from requests
- Get custom data from Analytic requests. Correlate that back to the Dimensions found in the org
- Check if /topqueries or /querysuggest is being called
- Check if /open or /click event is being called

Implementation
- Check usage of Queries (See Query Check at Organization Checker)
- Constant queries will be checked if they change during searches
- Queries will be executed with Debug=1 so we can get the ExecutionReport to see which Ranking has been done on the querypipeline level
- Load time
- State in code
- Partial matching and other settings which could influence performance
- Using custom events

UI 
- Facets, Tabs, Sorts
- Using recommendation components
- Underscore templates
- Raw field access in code
- Cultures which are used
